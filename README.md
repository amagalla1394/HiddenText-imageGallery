# HiddenText-imageGallery
<p><h3>Responsive HTML w/ CSS that displays hidden text when hovering over an image tile.</h3></p>

  <i>NOTE</i> - </br>
  <p>The images are all programmed to the same size and will display equal width according to the page width.</p>
  This can be best used with more images and for a multitude of projects and ideas:<br/>
    --> image gallery on portfolio site or webpage (static / dynamic)<br/>
    --> calendar web application for a more full width view.  { Might require modification to the code depending on the final product }
    
 <br/><br/>
 <p>@media queries are used to set a range of desired screen resolutions ranging from a 320px mobile view --> 2440px monitor look.</p>

 Overall, enjoy and have fun!
