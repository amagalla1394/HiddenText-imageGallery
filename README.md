# HiddenText-imageGallery
Responsive HTML w/ CSS that displays hidden text when hovering over an image tile.

NOTE - 
  The image sources are all programmed to the same size and will display equal width according to the page width.
  This can be best used with more images and for a multitude of projects and ideas:
    --> image gallery on portfolio site or webpage (static / dinamic)
    --> calendar web application for a more full width view....  {
           This idea might require modification to the code dependant on the goal or final product
           }
          
 @media queries are used to set a range of desired screen resolutions ranging from a 320px mobile view --> 2440px monitor look.
 
 Overall enjoy and have fun!
